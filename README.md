# healthy-on-the-go

This is my personal project using Bootstrap and is an experiment to learn more about this CSS framework. I created a guide for fast food and restaurant meals that are macro-friendly. The project uses HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.

## Description
Link: https://hstanekz.github.io/healthy-on-the-go/

The goal of this project is to help people stay on track with their fitness goals while still being able to enjoy their favorite meals. The guide includes a list of 26 popular restaurant chains with links to their nutritional information. Each restaurant's nutritional information is displayed on a separate card when clicked on the list.

## Features

- Sticky scroll-to-top button
- Three tabs: Restaurant Guide, Understanding Macros, and Tracking Macros.
- List of 26 popular restaurant chains with links to their nutritional information.
- Each restaurant's nutritional information is displayed on a separate card when clicked on the list.
- Smooth scrolling between list items using the scrollspy feature.

## Future Improvements

- Expand the database of restaurants and meals.
- Allow users to add their own custom meals to the database.
- Provide more detailed nutritional information, such as fiber and sugar content.
- Allow users to export their meal planner data for tracking in other apps or programs. 
- Integration of a restaurant API: Could integrate an API that provides up-to-date and accurate nutritional information for each restaurant. This would improve the accuracy of the guide and save time on manual updates.
